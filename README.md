# Tip Calculator App

### Vanilla JAvascript Project

#### Project description

##### Our objective is to develop a contemporary tip calculator in this project. The main interface of the project features a visually appealing container labeled "Tip Calculator," equipped with two input fields: one for entering the bill amount and the other for specifying the desired tip percentage. The tip calculator boasts a modern design that has been meticulously crafted using CSS, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing user experience. Leveraging the power of JavaScript, we have implemented functionality to capture the values entered in the input fields and calculate the total amount based on these inputs.
